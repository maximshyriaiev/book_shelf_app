## Introduction
Book Shelf App is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable laws. As this is an educational project, no real user data is collected or stored beyond essential functionality.

- **Usage Data**: No analytics or logging of user activity is performed.

## User Rights under GDPR
- **Consent**: You provide consent via the cookie popup. Consent can be withdrawn at any time by clearing cookies or rejecting in the popup.
- **Access and Deletion**: Since no data is stored, there is nothing to access or delete. If you believe any data is held, contact us.
- **Data Portability**: Not applicable, as no user data is collected.
